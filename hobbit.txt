This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, ***** his name was Baggins. The
Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, *****
people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were
rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected:
you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of
asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, ***** found
himself doing ***** saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the
neighbours’ respect, but he gained—well, you will see whether he gained
anything in the end.
The mother of our particular hobbit—what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits
need some description nowadays, since they have become rare ***** shy of the
Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our
height, ***** smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is
little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps
them to disappear quietly ***** quickly when large stupid folk like you ***** me
come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a
mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours
(chiefly green ***** yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural
leathery soles ***** thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is
curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, ***** laugh deep
fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can
get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this
hobbit—of Bilbo Baggins, that is—was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the
three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived
across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said
(in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a
fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something
not entirely hobbitlike about them, ***** once in a while members of the Tookclan would go ***** have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, ***** the family
hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the
Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.
Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs.
Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo’s father, built the most luxurious hobbithole for her (***** partly with her money) that was to be found either under The
Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, ***** there they remained to the end of
their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked *****
behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid ***** comfortable father, got
something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only
waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins
was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, ***** living in the beautiful
hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had
in fact apparently settled down immovably.
